# Overview
1. Implementing data engineering, data cleaning and manipulation using pandas.
2. Splitting test and train data.
3. Using underdamping technique for normal data to make it in balance with fraud data.
4. Create a feed forward NN with one i/p layer, one o/p layer and 2 hidden layers.
5. Train the model and caluclate training and testing accuracy.
6. Visualiztion of results.
7. Took care of over-fitting using dropout, L2 regularization.
8. Please go through Fraud_python_nn.ipynb and find the plots the very end for plots for training and testing accuracy, loss.
9. This model could detect with an accuracy of around 93%.
